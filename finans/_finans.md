# Finance

## Finance as science

- Shows how people choose between uncertain future values
- Studies economic problems for alternatives that involve time, money and uncertainty
- Went from descriptive to analytic and quentitative
- 2 angles of approach
  - Solving decision problems in practice (managerial finance)
  - Generate knowledge of general validity (theory of finance)
- Main tools of finance
  - Formulation of theories
  - Empirical testing through confrontation with real-life data
  - Application of results
- Interlocking cycles of scientific and applied results

- Finance as theoretical science
  - Takes actual, relevant problem
  - Make problem manageable by simplifying assumptions
    - Greedy investors, no transaction cost, etc.
  - Translate into mathematical terms
  - Use math to formulate predictions
    - Hypotheses
    - Prices
- Finance as empirical science
  - Tests financial theories
  - Confronts solutions with real-life data
    - Prices on financial stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.
    - Accounting and other data
  - Empirical relations in finance are special
- Finance as an applied science
  - Use results of not rejected theories to:
    - Buy or sell on financial market
    - Accept or reject investment proposal
    - Choose capital structure for project or company
- Nature of financial economics
  - Makes relations less precise
    - Studies how people choose between uncertain future values
      - Largely unpredictable due to financial
    - On markets, accurate predictions self-destruct
      - Information allowing accurate prices immediately incorporated into pricing
      - Later price changes depend on new information
  - Market efficiency
    - Explains why important study objects like stock price should be unpredictable
  - Financial market functions properly if there is high unexplained variance

## Time value of money
- Free risk interest rate
  - 1 USD today is worth more than 1 USD tomorrow
  - "Price" of postponing/advancing consumption
  - Does not include compensation of risk
  - 2 reasons why?
    - Time preferences (human inpacience)
      - Prefer present to future consumption
    - Productive investment opportunities
      - Increase consumption later by giving up consumption now
- Consequence
  - Amounts cannot be compared in different points in time
  - Amounts have to be moved through time to same point, adjusting for time value
    - *Compounding* if moved forward in time
    - *Discounting* if moved backward in time
  - Interest is compounded when
    - Added to principal sum
    - Starts earning interest
    - Formula interest: $FV_T = PV(1+r)^T$
      - $FV$: future value
      - $PV$: present value
      - $r$: interest rate
  - Same principle applies to discounting
    - Now we want to find $PV$
    - Formula: $PV = \frac{FV_T}{(1+r)^T}$
  - Compounding periods are not necessarily the same as interest periods
    - Corporate bonds often pay interest 2 times per year even though interest rate is annual
    - Effective annual rate for 10\% annual rate becomes $1.05^2 = 1.1025$
    - Formula for future value with variable comopound frequency is $FV_T = PV(1+\frac{r}{n})^{T_n}$
    - If $n\to \infty$, the formula becomes $FV_T = PV[(1+\frac{r}{n})^\frac{n}{r}]^{rT}$
    - Remember $e = \lim_{c \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{c})^c \approx 2.71828\dots$
    - Formula becomes $FV_T = PV\cdot e^{rT}$
    - Normal to use logarithmic rates as follows: $\ln(\frac{FV_T}{PV}) = rT$
    - Advantageous if calculating daily stock prices
      - $\ln(\frac{FV_1}{PV_1}\cdot \frac{FV_2}{PV_2}) = \ln(\frac{FV_1}{PV_1}) + \ln(\frac{FV_2}{PV_2}) = r_1 + r_2$
      - Not additive accross investments
- Annuities and perpetuities
  - Cash flows often come in series
  - Annuity = yearly, perpetuity = forever
  - Use math to calculate value
  - Series of $n$ peyments of amount $A$: $PV = \frac{A}{1+r} + \frac{A}{(1+r)^2}+\dots+\dots+\frac{A}{(1+r)^n}$
  - Gordon growth model = present value of perpetuity
  - Formula: $PV = \frac{A}{r}$ (easily derived, apparently)
  - Formule for perpetuity witht growth $g$: $PV=\frac{A}{r-g}, r>g$
  - Often used due to simplicity

## Risk and valuation

- Valuation is important
- Defined as discounted value of expected future cash flow over time
- Formula: $Value = \sum^t\frac{Exp[Cashflow_t]}{(1+discount_t)^t}$
- Two major dimentions to value: time and risk
- Risk
  - Can be accounted for in different ways
    - Adjust discount rate
      - Use Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or
      - Use Ross' Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)
      - Formula becomes $Value = \sum^t\frac{Exp[Cashflow_t]}{(1+risk\space adjusted\space discount_t)^t}$
    - Adjust cash flow to certainty equivalent cash flows
      - Using CAPM or
      - Derivative securities such as futures
      - Formula becomes $Value = \sum^t\frac{CertaintyEquivalent[Cashflow_t]}{(1+risk\space adjusted\space discount_t)^t}$
    - Adjust probabilities from normal to risk-neutral or equivalent martingale probabilities
      - Black & Scholes or binomial option pricing
      - Formula becomes $Value = \sum^t\frac{Exp^P[Cashflow_t]}{(1+risk\space adjusted\space discount_t)^t}$
